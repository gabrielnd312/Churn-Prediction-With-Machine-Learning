Apple is one of the largest companies in the world in the field of electronics and software. It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.

The duo attempted to sell their project to HP and Atari, but both companies declined, stating that personal computers had no future in the market. Faced with the disbelief of major companies in their work, the pair decided to produce computers using their own resources and sell them independently.

Despite some initially market underperforming products and several failures, Apple has become one of the most important companies in the world and frequently competes for the title of the world's most valuable company.

Today, their products are renowned worldwide. However, another interesting perspective on the company's history is to track the price of its stock over time.

This analysis aims to highlight key milestones in the company's history through its stock value, indicating significant market moments, the stability of its growth, and its current situation.
