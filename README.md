Churn rate, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, is a vital metric for businesses that measures the percentage of customers who cease their engagement or subscription with a company over a specific period.

We can exemplify with a streaming service company, the churn analysis is done on top of subscribers who canceled the service in a given period analyzed.
This period can be varied, in week, month, bimonthly, half-yearly, annual or other options.

This metric helps companies gauge the health of their customer base and the effectiveness of their customer retention strategies.

Understanding churn rate is crucial because it directly impacts a company's revenue and growth potential.
A high churn rate indicates that a significant number of customers are leaving, potentially leading to a decline in revenue. On the other hand, a low churn rate signifies strong customer loyalty and a stable revenue stream.

By analyzing churn rate and its associated factors like customer satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty, companies can make informed decisions to enhance their products, services, and customer support. Churn prediction and management strategies can be developed to proactively address issues and improve customer retention. Ultimately, keeping churn rate in check fosters sustainable growth and strengthens a company's competitive position in the market.


In the project carried out, we identified the main points of the company performing an extensive exploratory analysis, filtered the necessary variables with Feature Engineering, created a baseline for the predictive model, as well as customized our Machine Learning model based on XGBoost.
